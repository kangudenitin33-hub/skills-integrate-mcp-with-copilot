# Improve OpenAPI schema and docs

Description:
Expand API documentation with examples, response schemas, and clearer descriptions so clients can integrate easily.

Acceptance criteria:
- Add Pydantic models with examples so generated docs show sample payloads.
- Add operation descriptions for each endpoint.
- Ensure the static UI at `/static/index.html` links to the OpenAPI JSON and docs.

Notes:
No external docs site required; enhance built-in FastAPI docs.
