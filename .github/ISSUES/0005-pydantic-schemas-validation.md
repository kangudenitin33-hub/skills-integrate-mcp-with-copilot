# Add Pydantic schemas and input validation

Description:
Introduce Pydantic models for request and response bodies to validate inputs (especially email format) and improve OpenAPI docs.

Acceptance criteria:
- Define request/response models for activity creation, signup, and participant responses.
- Validate `email` fields using Pydantic's `EmailStr`.
- Replace plain function params with `body` models where appropriate.
- Update OpenAPI docs generated by FastAPI to reflect models.

Notes:
This change should be non-breaking for existing clients using query params; consider deprecation path if switching to JSON bodies.
