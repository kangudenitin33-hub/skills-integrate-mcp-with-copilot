Title: Add dependency vulnerability scanning and update outdated dependencies

Impact:
- Unpatched dependencies may contain known CVEs enabling remote exploitation or privilege escalation.

Suggested fix:
- Enable automated dependency scanning (Dependabot, Snyk, or similar).
- Run `npm audit` / `pip-audit` and address findings.
- Update or pin vulnerable packages; prefer non-breaking upgrades or patch backports.
- Add CI job to fail builds on high/critical CVEs and auto-open PRs for updates.
